## Electron - React Starter
This is boilerplate/scaffolding application with Electron (the javascript toolkit for developing desktop apps with nodeJS and chromium) and ReactJS (the javascript library for building user interfaces).

### Getting started
1. Clone this repo and run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev`

`npm run dev` uses an npm module called foreman to start the webpack dev server for react, and then launch the electron app once the dev server is up and handling traffic.
